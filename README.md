# Postfix-Infix-Expression-Calculator
Language: C

stack.h/stack.c and stack_string.h/stack_string.c are the various stack implementations needed for these programs

Program Descriptions:
- Double_Stack_Calculator: Takes an infix expression, converts it to postfix, then evaluates the expression using a double stack: a stack of integers and a stack of operators. Works for +, -, * , /, positive/negative numbers, integer/floating point numbers, and square roote denoted by $
- Postfix_Calculator: takes a postfix expression and evluates it. Works for +, -, * , /, positive/negative numbers, integer/floating point numbers, and square roote denoted by $.
- Infix_To_Postfix: converts an infix expression to a postfix expression. Works for +, -, * , /, positive/negative numbers, integer/floating point numbers, and square roote denoted by $.
- Postfix_To_Infix: converts a postfix expression to an infix expression. Works for +, -, * , /, positive/negative numbers, integer/floating point numbers, and square roote denoted by $.
